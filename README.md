# thekla-grant-app
A prototype submitted as part of a grant application to Thekla, Inc.

The game is written in pure html/javascript, so is opened and played with a web browser.

It was created and tested using Firefox. (Lastest version tested: 59.0.2, 64-bit)

When opened with Google Chrome (lastest version tested: 66.0.3359.117, 64-bit) it plays the same, but there is a minor aesthetic difference: a blue border appears around the canvas (which is absent when played with Firefox).
